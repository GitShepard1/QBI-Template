abstract = {In neuroscience, experimental designs in which multiple observations are collected from a single research object (for example, multiple neurons from one animal) are common: 53{\%} of 314 reviewed papers from five renowned journals included this type of data. These so-called 'nested designs' yield data that cannot be considered to be independent, and so violate the independency assumption of conventional statistical methods such as the t test. Ignoring this dependency results in a probability of incorrectly concluding that an effect is statistically significant that is far higher (up to 80{\%}) than the nominal $\alpha$ level (usually set at 5{\%}). We discuss the factors affecting the type I error rate and the statistical power in nested data, methods that accommodate dependency between observations and ways to determine the optimal study design when data are nested. Notably, optimization of experimental designs nearly always concerns collection of more truly independent observations, rather than more observations from one research object.},

abstract = {Joint models for longitudinal and survival data are particularly relevant to many cancer clinical trials and observational studies in which longitudinal biomarkers (eg, circulating tumor cells, immune response to a vaccine, and quality-of-life measurements) may be highly associated with time to event, such as relapse-free survival or overall survival. In this article, we give an introductory overview on joint modeling and present a general discussion of a broad range of issues that arise in the design and analysis of clinical trials using joint models. To demonstrate our points throughout, we present an analysis from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial E1193, as well as examine some operating characteristics of joint models through simulation studies.},

abstract = {This paperback edition is a reprint of the 2000 edition. This book provides an overview of the theory and application of linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data, such as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures areincluded in the book. The NLME package for analyzing mixed-effects models in R and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel and efficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models. Jos√© C. Pinheiro is a Senior Biometrical Fellow at Novartis Pharmaceuticals, having worked at Bell Labs during the time this book was produced. He has published extensively in mixed-effects models, dose finding methods in clinical development, and other areas of biostatistics. Douglas M. Bates is Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is the author, with Donald G. Watts, of Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications, a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and a former chair of the Statistical Computing Section.},

abstract = {Abstract Developmental studies in animals often violate the assumption of statistical independence of observations due to the hierarchical nature of the data (i.e., pups cluster by litter, correlation of individual observations over time). Mixed effect modeling (MEM) provides a robust analytical approach for addressing problems associated with hierarchical data. This article compares the application of MEM to traditional ANOVA models within the context of a developmental study of prenatal ethanol exposure in mice. The results of the MEM analyses supported the ANOVA results in showing that a large proportion of the variability in both behavioral score and brain weight could be explained by ethanol. The MEM also identified that there were significant interactions between ethanol and litter size in relation to behavioral scores and brain weight. In addition, the longitudinal modeling approach using linear MEM allowed us to model for flexible weight gain over time, as well as to provide precise estimates of these effects, which would be difficult in repeated measures ANOVA. ¬© 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
